    <h3>Video Analytics System for Natural Language-Driven Surveillance</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Traditional surveillance systems require manual rule-setting and lack adaptability to
        dynamic environments like ports or industrial sites. They often fail in challenging scenarios like occlusions,
        aerial views, or ambiguous human-object interactions.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution &amp; Architecture:</strong> This system enables natural language-driven video analysis using a
        pipeline of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Object Detection:</strong> YOLOv8, Detectron2, GroundingDINO, and OWL-ViT models fine-tuned on
            marine/industrial datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> DeepSORT for temporal tracking of people, containers, cranes, and spreaders.</li>
        <li><strong>Action Recognition:</strong> Models like SlowFast and TimeSformer detect meaningful actions over
            N-frame windows.</li>
        <li><strong>Video LLMs:</strong> InternVideo 2.5, Llava, and VideoLLaMA3 tested on port and domestic videos
            using context-aware prompts.</li>
        <li><strong>Query Agent:</strong> Breaks down user queries into subtasks (e.g., proximity detection, container
            motion) and interprets results using GPT-4 or similar LLMs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>System Architecture: </strong></p>

    <p><strong>Experiments & Observations:</strong> The team evaluated multiple VideoLLMs across scenarios (with/without
        blur/highlighting), revealing hallucination risks and gaps in temporal reasoning. Prompt engineering,
        object-aware attention, and subtask chaining significantly improved relevance.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The proposed architecture supports near-real-time analytics in industrial setups with
        minimal rule authoring. It offers an extensible framework for querying unstructured video via conversational
        inputâ€”helping ensure safety (e.g., worker too close to moving container) and increasing automation in
        surveillance tasks.</p>
